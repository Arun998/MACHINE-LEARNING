# MACHINE_LEARNING <br />

***Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy***

## *SUPERVISED MACHINE_LEARNING* <br />

***Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning used to train models from labeled training data. It allows you to predict output for future or unseen data*** <br />

### Types of supervised learning algorithms<br />
 - REGRESSION 
 - CLASSIFICATION
### Regression types:<br />
                    1. LINEAR_REGRESSION
                    2. MULTIPLE_LINEAR_REGRESSION
                    3. POLYNOMIAL_REGRESSION
 #### LINEAR_REGRESSION,<br />
 Linear Regression is a statistical model used to predict the relationship between independent and 
dependent variables denoted by x and y respectively
* **Examine 2 factors** <br />
1. How closely are x and y related ?
Linear regression gives a number
between -1 and 1 indicating
the strength of correlation 
between the two variables
0 : no correlation 
1 : positively correlated 
-1 : negatively correlated

2. Prediction
When the relationship between x 
and y is known, use this to predict 
future values of y for a value of x 
This is done by fitting a regression 
line and represented by a linear equation:
y = a * x + b
